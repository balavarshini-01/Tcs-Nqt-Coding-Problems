/*Given an array consists of n elements you have to print the elements which has appeared even number of times

a) N size of array

b) Next line contains elements of array

Print the elements which has appeared even number of times

Constraints:

Size of array should be greater than zero

Elements of array should be greater than zero

Input Format:

1) The first line of input contains the value N size of array

II) The second line of input contains elements of array

Output Format:

Print the elements which have appeared even number of times

Sample Input1:

N=5

L[]=1 1 2 3 2

Sample Output 1:

1 2
(as 1 has appeared 2 times and 2 has appeared 2 times which is even so we print elements 1 and 2) */
